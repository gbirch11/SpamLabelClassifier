## Weakly Supervised Spam Label Classification

This website represents our static version for our findings on classifying spam into different labels.


## **Abstract**
Given the abundance of spam that occurs in today's day and age, our goal is to classify spam messages into some of the most common categories and find trends within these categories that could hopefully improve spam detection systems currently in place. Using a variety of methods in Natural Language Processing spanning from simple to complex methods, we will explore the benefits and downsides of using such models.
